  <p>Welcome to the archival site for my undergraduate research! My name is Allison Masangkay, and I'm pursuing this project as a part of the <a href="https://anthropology.washington.edu/honors-program" target="_blank" class="links">UW Anthropology Honors Program</a> between March 2017 and June 2018. I'll periodically update the content on here during that time. You can learn more about this work below in my abstract. Find out more about me at <a href="http://allisonmasangkay.com" target="_blank">allisonmasangkay.com</a>, and contact me at <a href="mailto:acmasang@uw.edu">acmasang@uw.edu</a> if you're interested in getting involved or have any questions.</p>
  <h2 class="ocean-solid">Abstract</h2>
<p><i>The only certainty in young Filipino-Americans’ identities is multiplicity. Psychological studies have identified a shared colonial mentality and overall high rates of self-harming mental health statistics among Filipino-Americans, given the Philippines’ centuries-long oppression from several countries and the United States’ ongoing imperial relationship with the archipelago. Though, outside of limited discourse in psychology and some social sciences surrounding Filipino-American diaspora, there is little exploration of how colonialism possibly has negative health effects on the Filipino-American population—and, furthermore, what can be done to alleviate this problem. A synthesis of the ideas behind identity (i.e. racial, ethnic, and cultural) and diaspora lend themselves to an exploration of the embodied experiences of young Filipino-Americans who have encountered migration to the United States personally or within their immediate family. Historical trauma—a concept to describe the trauma and other embodied impacts of colonization, cultural suppression, and historical oppression—has been primarily been explored in indigenous populations, among others. These studies present foundational knowledge of how historical oppression has transgenerational effects on marginalized communities. Beyond the scope of institutional inquiry, engagement in music culture by today’s young Filipino-Americans is a site of interest to explore how they navigate their colonial, diasporic identities and bodies. In order to examine the relationships between music and the lived experiences of historical trauma among young Filipino-Americans, an applied, ethnographic study among self-identified Filipino-American young adults, and music artists bridges the gap between known oppressions and the practice of music as resistance and, possibly, healing.</i></p>
